# Salary_Predictor

- Prediced salary based on the number of years of experience in France, Spain and Germnay.
- Imported, cleaned and pre-processed data from a csv file by using pandas and scikit-learn libraries. 
- Visualized the data trends between years of experience and salary by using linear regression.
- Segregated the predictor into test and training set for prediction of original and newer data points.

## Steps:
1. Imported numpy, matplotlib, and pandas libraries and read the csv data file.
2. Divided the dataset into x-axis and y-axis.
3. Elimintated the missing data using scikit-learn library by importing SimpleImputer.
4. Converted the data into categorical data by importing ColumnTransfer, OneHotEncoder, and LabelEncoder.
5. Break the data-set into trainging and testing sets.
6. From scikit-learn library, import LinearRegression and fit the data points on the regressor.
7. Predict the values fot new data points.
